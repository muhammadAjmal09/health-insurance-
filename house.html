                <h6>Homeowner's policy is a multiple-line insurance policy, meaning that it includes both property
                    insurance and liability coverage, with an indivisible premium, meaning that a single premium is paid
                    for all risks. This means that it covers both damage to one's property and liability for any
                    injuries and property damage caused by the owner or members of his/her family to other people. It
                    may also include damage caused by household pets. The U.S. uses standardized policy forms that
                    divide coverage into several categories. Coverage limits are typically provided as a percentage of
                    the primary Coverage A, which is coverage for the main dwelling.[1]
                    <br><br>

                    The cost of homeowner's insurance often depends on what it would cost to replace the house and which
                    additional endorsements or riders are attached to the policy. The insurance policy is a legal
                    contract between the insurance carrier (insurance company) and the named insured(s). It is a
                    contract of indemnity and will put the insured back to the state he/she was in prior to the loss.
                    Typically, claims due to floods or war (whose definition typically includes a nuclear explosion from
                    any source) are excluded from coverage, amongst other standard exclusions (like termites). Special
                    insurance can be purchased for these possibilities, including flood insurance. Insurance is adjusted
                    to reflect the cost of replacement, usually upon application of an inflation factor or a cost index.

                <h4>In the United States</h4>
                <br>
                <h6>In the United States, most home buyers borrow money in the form of a mortgage loan, and the mortgage
                    lender often requires that the buyer purchase homeowner's insurance as a condition of the loan, in
                    order to protect the bank if the home is destroyed. Anyone with an insurable interest in the
                    property should be listed on the policy. In some cases the mortgagee will waive the need for the
                    mortgagor to carry homeowner's insurance if the value of the land exceeds the amount of the mortgage
                    balance. In such a case even the total destruction of any buildings would not affect the ability of
                    the lender to be able to foreclose and recover the full amount of the loan.
                    <br><br>

                    Home insurance in the United States may differ from other countries; for example, in Britain,
                    subsidence and subsequent foundation failure is usually covered under an insurance policy.[7] United
                    States insurance companies used to offer foundation insurance, which was reduced to coverage for
                    damage due to leaks, and finally eliminated altogether.[8] The insurance is often misunderstood by
                    its purchasers; for example, many believe that mold is covered when it is not a standard
                    coverage.[9]
                </h6>
                <br>
                <h4>History</h4>
                <br>
                <h6>The first homeowner's policy per se in the United States was introduced in September 1950, but
                    similar policies had already existed in Great Britain and certain areas of the United States. In the
                    late 1940s, US insurance law was reformed and during this process multiple line statutes were
                    written, allowing homeowner's policies to become legal.[10]

                    Prior to the 1950s there were separate policies for the various perils that could affect a home. A
                    homeowner would have had to purchase separate policies covering fire losses, theft, personal
                    property, and the like. During the 1950s policy forms were developed allowing the homeowner to
                    purchase all the insurance they needed on one complete policy. However, these policies varied by
                    insurance company, and were difficult to comprehend.[11]
                    <br><br>

                    The need for standardization grew so great that a private company based in Jersey City, New Jersey,
                    Insurance Services Office, also known as the ISO, was formed in 1971 to provide risk information and
                    it issued simplified homeowner's policy forms for reselling to insurance companies. These policies
                    have been amended over the years.[citation needed]
                    <br><br>
                    Modern developments have changed the insurance coverage terms, availability, and pricing.[2]
                    Homeowner's insurance has been relatively unprofitable, due in part to catastrophes such as
                    hurricanes as well as regulators' reluctance to authorize price increases.[2] Coverages have been
                    reduced instead and companies have diverged from the former standardized model ISO forms.[2] Water
                    damage due to burst pipes in particular has been restricted or in some cases entirely eliminated.[2]
                    Other restrictions included time limits, complex replacement cost calculations (which may not
                    reflect the true cost to replace), and reductions in wind damage coverage.[2]</h6>
